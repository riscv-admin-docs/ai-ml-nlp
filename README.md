# RISC-V AI/ML SIG
The goal of AI/ML SIG is to promote the research and standardization of global RISC-V AI instruction architecture, basic software and core application technologies. Also, responsible for coordinating RISC-V international AI technology ecological construction and standard formulation.

[Charter](https://github.com/riscv-admin/ai-ml/blob/main/CHARTER.md)
- ISA for AI/ ML: Organizing global research, development and evaluation of RISC-V ISA extensions for AI/ML acceleration;
- AI Software: Optimize a full software stack especially graph compiler to translate ONNX graph models to RISC-V architecture to support portability of ML, AI and NLP applications;
- Systems & Applications: Specify the benchmarks, performance metrics, and the evaluation methodology that will be used to track performance comparisons of optimized vs. current implementations and vs. other popular architectures;
- Co-optimization: Propose software-hardware co-optimizations for better support of the target applications.

# Collaboration
We are a mixture of volunteers and member companies trying to bring RISC-V to new domains. The group welcomes collaboration, with the solely condition that you join the RISC-V Foundation under the (really reasonable) terms and conditions in the [membership](https://riscv.org/membership/) section from the RISC-V Foundation website. Welcome to join us!
If you have any questions，you can email the group organizers for additional information:
- Chair: Xichuan Zhou <zxc@cqu.edu.cn>
- Vice-chair: Suresh Sugumar <suresh.sugumar@gmail.com>
